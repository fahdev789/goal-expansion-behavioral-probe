This repository documents a small behavioral probe exploring goal expansion in large language models under varying prompt constraint strenghts.

The focus is experimental hygiene:
- isolating when goal expansion appears
- identifying when it is suppressed
- noting cases when probing itself induces the behavior being measured

No claims of novelty or generalization are made.
