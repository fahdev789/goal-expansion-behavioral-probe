### Summary:
- Under hard constraints (C0), expansion was suppressed
- Under soft framing or unconstrained prompts (C1), expansion was appeared consistently.
- The behavior persisted across fresh chats and chats with history.

Responses with Fresh chat and after having the history. You can see these 2 conversations are showing up that Goal expansion sometimes history sensitive. Same prompt but with different chat history revolves different behavior. Please see the below links:

### Note on experimental controls:
Initial exploratory runs suggested frequent goal expansion. After clarifying constraint definitions and separating hard prohibitions from soft framing, the behavior was re-evaluated under controlled conditions. Results reported here reflect only the controlled runs.
